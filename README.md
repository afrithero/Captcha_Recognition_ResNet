# Captcha Recognition with ResNet

This repository implements a deep learning-based Captcha recognition system using the ResNet architecture. The goal is to accurately predict the characters in Captcha images by leveraging the feature extraction power of convolutional neural networks.

The current implementation supports inference on Captcha images, and more details (including training pipeline, dataset information) will be added soon.

## Features
- ResNet-based architecture
- Supports multi-character Captcha prediction

## Coming Soon
- Training script and dataset preparation
- Evaluation metrics
- Model optimization and deployment guide

Stay tuned for updates!
